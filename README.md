PDF-Word-Translator

This project was developed to solve the problem while reading the PDF files. When you read the PDF file and you want to know the meaning of some words then you have to switch
to google translator to find the meaning of the word.If there are many words then it creates an overhead for the user to switch between the file and google translator.So, to avoid
this overhead we have included a feature to find the meaning of the word in the PDF file itself.
